# Selection Sort in Java

This Java program demonstrates the **Selection Sort** algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. The user is prompted to enter the size of the array and its elements, after which the sorted result is displayed.

## ðŸ§  What is Selection Sort?

Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the input array into a sorted and unsorted region, and repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and moves it to the sorted region.

**Time Complexity:**
- Best Case: O(nÂ²)
- Average Case: O(nÂ²)
- Worst Case: O(nÂ²)

**Space Complexity:** O(1)
